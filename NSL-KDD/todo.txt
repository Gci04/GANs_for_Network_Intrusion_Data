1. Increase upsmapling (3k or 4k) and check the results -- DONE
2. If possible plot the generator and discriminator loss. -- DONE
3. Add KL-divergence in to the pipeline. -- DONE
4. Weâ€™ll also keep the separate Classifier for validation. -- DONE
5. Try different architectures and parameters. -- DONE
6. Think about the visualization of both generator and discriminator spaces. -- In progress

-----------27.08.2018----------------

1. loss(on fake and real) experiment
2. plot for couple of features during training (see if any mode collapse exist)
3. Try to visualization of fake and real data durring training using TSNE : Comment-- makes the training
longer. (dropped), Used PCA for visualization -- DONE
4. Implement early_stopping strategy (using KL-divergence or any other metric)
5. Monitor the discriminator loss on real and fake datapoints : Comment -- Using probe attack
the behaviour follows the expected behaviour. -- Not DONE
6. Fix Keras bug with using model.trainable after compile. -- DONE
